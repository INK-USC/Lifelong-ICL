The CMSI includes representatives from across the banking, insurance and investment sectors alongside pre-eminent Australian climate scientists working together under the auspices of the National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change (ESCC) Hub, professional services firms and finance sector industry bodies. The objectives of the CMSI are to provide open- source voluntary guidelines for financial institutions (banks, insurers and asset managers and owners) with consistent scientific and technical guidance on how to assess the physical risk of climate-related damage to homes, buildings and other critical infrastructure arising from extreme weather events - such as tropical cyclones, bushfires and floods. The CMSI focused on supporting implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations in addition to better understanding the financial system's exposures to climate-related risks. Two key reports were published in the 2020 financial year, including a finance report and a science report which are available at: https://www.cmsi.org.au/reports - Climate-KIC Australia (Climate-KIC) - The Group has been working with Climate-KIC and a number of other organisations, including government agencies and industry bodies on an Adaptation Finance Project. This project is exploring how the financial sector can invest in climate adaptation to deliver commercial returns and greater climate resilience with a view to developing insights into the creation of a scalable approach to adaptation finance. In 2020, the project completed a report that shares insights and makes recommendations for current and future projects focused on addressing the adaptation finance gap. This work has contributed to the adaptation finance discourse in Australia - the report is available at: https://climate-kic.org.au/our-projects/ adaptation-finance-project/ - Resilience Investment Vehicle (RIV) - The Group has been working with IAG, CSIRO and a number of other government agencies, industry groups and not-for-profits on a RIV.

{"text": "Changes in the portfolio\u2019s carbon footprint may occur for two reasons: a change in portfolio composition or a change in the emissions of investee companies. Not until companies reduce their real emissions will we see a reduction of atmospheric carbon and an improvement in the climate. In the past, it was not possible to show the reasons for changes in portfolio carbon footprint. However, the AP funds in 2019 were for the first time able to quantify changes over time in total carbon emissions and portfolio-weighted carbon intensity. Nevertheless, the metrics have limitations that restrict their applicability for measuring total portfolio climate risk and impact. This is because the figures do not, for example, include carbon emissions caused indirectly by investee business activities.", "label": "metrics", "id": "train_4_69"}
{"text": "To test the resilience of new projects, we assess potential costs associated with GHG emissions when evaluating all new investments. Our approach applies a uniform project screening value (PSV) of $40 (real terms) per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent to the total GHG emissions of each investment. This PSV is generally applied when evaluating our new projects around the world to test their resilience across a range of future scenarios. The project development process features a number of checks that may require development of detailed GHG and energy management plans. High-emitting projects undergo additional sensitivity testing, including the potential for future CCS projects. Projects in the most GHG-exposed asset classes have GHG intensity targets that reflect standards sufficient to allow them to compete and prosper in a more CO2 regulated future. These processes can lead to projects being stopped, designs being changed, and potential GHG mitigation investments being identified, in preparation for when regulation would make these investments commercially compelling.", "label": "risk", "id": "train_4_70"}
{"text": "Responding to the threats of climate change Our exposure to climate change falls into two broad categories. Physical risks, particularly to our property assets from severe weather events; and transition risks from the move to a low carbon economy, which will impact the value of investments associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The two risks are linked. Continued emissions will increase physical risks, and limiting the impacts will require substantial emission reductions increasing transition risks.", "label": "strategy", "id": "train_4_71"}

{"text": "Due to the overlapping nature of the environmental services that WM provides and climate-related issues, the risks and opportunities are discussed, in whole or in part, at each meeting through one or all of the following governance mechanisms: strategy, major plans of action, risk management policies, annual budgets, business plans, performance objectives, major capital expenditures, and progress against goals and targets for addressing climate-related issues. Specifically, reviewing and guiding strategy is scheduled into every board meeting to inform the entire board and contribute to managing information, making decisions about what the company will do, and adapting those decisions based on climate-related information. Issues discussed in the reporting year include (1) the ability to provide carbon-reduction services such as recycling, composting, renewable energy, and advisory services; (2) direct GHG reductions from changes associated with our fleet, use of renewable energy, and operational efficiencies; (3) physical risk of severe weather to our employees, facilities, and ability to provide services, and (4) regulatory risk associated with climate change policy issues. Successful management of these issues relies not only upon significant investment in, for example, collection of landfill gas and production of renewable natural gas (RNG) and state-of-the-art material recovery facilities leveraging robotics and automation, but also an overarching strategic plan to address the financial viability of recycling, deployment of capital in our fleet, and WM\u2019s ongoing development of landfill-gas-to-fuel facilities.
