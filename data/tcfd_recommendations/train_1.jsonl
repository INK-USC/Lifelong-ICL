Specifically, reviewing and guiding strategy is scheduled into every board meeting to inform the entire board and contribute to managing information, making decisions about what the company will do, and adapting those decisions based on climate-related information. Issues discussed in the reporting year include (1) the ability to provide carbon-reduction services such as recycling, composting, renewable energy, and advisory services; (2) direct GHG reductions from changes associated with our fleet, use of renewable energy, and operational efficiencies; (3) physical risk of severe weather to our employees, facilities, and ability to provide services, and (4) regulatory risk associated with climate change policy issues. Successful management of these issues relies not only upon significant investment in, for example, collection of landfill gas and production of renewable natural gas (RNG) and state-of-the-art material recovery facilities leveraging robotics and automation, but also an overarching strategic plan to address the financial viability of recycling, deployment of capital in our fleet, and WM\u2019s ongoing development of landfill-gas-to-fuel facilities. Therefore, reviewing and guiding strategy at each board meeting is essential to meeting goals and targets. Additionally, one-on-one sessions with the Committee Chairs are conducted on an ad hoc basis.", "label": "governance", "id": "train_1_66"}
