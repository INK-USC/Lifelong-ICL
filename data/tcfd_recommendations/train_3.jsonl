Our bankers also need to document the customer's knowledge of recent rainfall and climate trends where their farm is located and, if relevant, how they manage water budgets for irrigation.", "label": "risk", "id": "train_3_71"}

The losses of over 20% at the peak of the coronavirus crisis were moderate by comparison with the wider market. During the second half of the year, however, the HPC (home and personal care) sector, including Beiersdorf\u2019s shares, came under pressure. Lack of transparency around future market developments, fears of recession, and the effects of intense price competition overshadowed the general economic recovery in this period.
