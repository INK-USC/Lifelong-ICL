We are in the process of applying for membership to RE100, a global initiative dedicated to accelerating a global shift in clean energy, under which we will continue our objective of sourcing 100% renewable electricity. In addition, we are increasingly enabling and encouraging flexible working and reduced business travel, leading to further reductions in Scope 3 emissions under our direct control. \u2013 Approximately 200 of our people do have jobs that require a car, and a number of others have an optional car lease benefit as part of their compensation.
