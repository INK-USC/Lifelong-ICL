Each year the Treasury & Risk Management team performs top-down and bottom-up reviews across all headline risk areas to assess changes, identify emerging risks and prioritize risks for in-depth analysis. Top-down reviews consist of one-on-one meetings with every member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) as well as select group Area Vice Presidents to get a regional and operations-focused viewpoint on risk. Bottom-up reviews are done in workshop format including all subject matter experts for a given headline risk as well as participants from regional operations. An output from these meetings is a standardized scorecard which includes risk and opportunity ratings for (financial) impact, likelihood (of event), outlook (of risk exposure) and confidence (in risk management). Additionally, forward-looking action plans with measurable indicators and progress on action plans from previous assessments are also discussed & documented. Based on findings from top-down and bottom-up reviews, certain risks are identified as \u201cPriority Risks\u201d and receive a more granular assessment, quantification of impact, and are elevated for further discussion with the SLT and the Board. The executive team that manages our enterprise risk reporting to the Board reviews all submissions for consistency in determining scope of impacts, and comprehensiveness in determining the adequacy of current support by internal staff, the sufficiency of financial support for contractors or mitigation measures needed to manage and reduce risk, sufficiency of legal support, and the extent and sufficiency of third-party consulting support. Moreover, the staff working on the ERM documentation coordinate with those drafting the risk factor description for the Annual Report Form 10-K to assure thoroughness in response.
