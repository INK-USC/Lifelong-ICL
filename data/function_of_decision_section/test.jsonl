Conditioning a foreign state's exercise of treaty rights on submitting to the jurisdiction of United States courts could imperil the spirit of cooperation and comity underpinning that regime. In that context, there is good reason to doubt that a foreign state's effort to exercise its agreed-upon treaty rights exhibits an intent to relinquish its immunity from suit. And were we to find that a foreign state's extradition request implies a waiver of immunity in United States courts, we might expect that, as a reciprocal matter, the United States would subject itself to suit in foreign proceedings whenever it requests extradition assistance.

{"paragraph": "Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit presumes in cases involving \u00a7 924(c) \u201cthat sentences on each count of a multi-count indictment are part of a package that may, without a case specific inquiry, be revisited to ensure that the overall sentence on the surviving counts is consistent with the district court's intentions.\u201d United States v.

{"paragraph": "In sum, the district court articulated its sentencing rationale in clear and unmistakable terms. That rationale was plausible (indeed, compelling). The court reasonably concluded that the facts of the case made manifest the appellant's venality, his utter disregard for the plight of others, and the danger that he presented to the community. In view of this plausible rationale, we have no quarrel with the court's determination that an upwardly variant sentence was in order.", "label": "Decree", "id": "test_99"}
