He then modified the Order to allow mining operations to resume in the suspended area. All told, mine operations in the area stopped for about 2.5 hours total. The MSHA Inspector also started the diesel air compressor\u2014a piece of equipment that had been running in the vicinity of the ill miner\u2014and detected no elevated CO level from that device at that time. Returning to the mine a day later, the MSHA Inspector modified the Order to remove the diesel air compressor from service pending an investigation because it was the only variable the ill miner had not been regularly exposed to. The MSHA Inspector interviewed the ill miner and other miners who worked with him but did not uncover evidence of any elevated CO level.", "label": "Facts", "id": "train_4_129"}

Reid dealt with the proper interpretation of \u201ca work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment\u201d -- that is, the first way in which a work can qualify as a work for hire under the 1976 Act. 490 U.S. at 738, 109 S.Ct. 2166 (quoting *81 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(1)).

In so holding, the Court rejected an approach to \u00a7 101(1), adopted by some circuits, that had deemed a hired party an \u201cemployee\u201d if the hiring party had \u201ca right to control\u201d or \u201cactual control of\u201d the work.

{"paragraph": "Here, the district court addressed the three primary considerations, finding that Poland's default was the result of confusion rather than willfulness, that Poland's defense of sovereign immunity was meritorious, and that Khochinsky suffered no prejudice from vacatur of the default.

But \u201c[e]ven when a default is willful, a district court does not necessarily abuse its discretion by vacating a default when the asserted defense is meritorious and the district court took steps to mitigate any prejudice to the non-defaulting party.\u201d Gilmore, 843 F.3d at 966.

{"paragraph": "Neither M-Class nor the Commission identified non-speculative harms. That a member of the public could look at M-Class's compliance history, notice that there was a terminated \u00a7 103(k) order and conclude \u201csomething occurred at that mine that affected the health and safety of miners,\u201d Sec'y of Labor v. M-Class Mining, LLC, 42 FMSHRC 491, 496 (2020) (emphasis in original), is no more than a thinly-veiled reputational harm argument. Reputational harm, however, does not provide us with jurisdiction here. \u201cReputational harm may constitute an ongoing, redressable injury where it derives directly from an unexpired and unretracted government action,\u201d Pulphus v. Ayers, 909 F.3d 1148, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (internal quotations omitted); for example, if \u201ca governmental designation directly harmed the plaintiff's professional reputation because the designation was inherently stigmatizing,\u201d id. In other words, \u201cwhen injury to reputation is alleged as a secondary effect of an otherwise moot action, we have required that some tangible, concrete effect remain, susceptible to judicial correction.\u201d Id. at 1154 (internal quotations omitted). Any reputational harm to M-Class is tied to the possibility that someone might check M-Class's history of accidents and might draw a negative conclusion because of the terminated Order. Compared to the reputational harms discussed in Pulphus, M-Class's alleged reputational harm is distinguishable based both on no inherent stigmatization and on the uncertainty of reputational harm. Id. That the Order indicates \u201csomething\u201d occurred in M-Class's mine, without assignment of fault or causation, differs greatly from an act of the Congress embodying a determination that an individual was a child abuser and danger to his own daughter, Foretich v. United States, 351 F.3d 1198, 1213 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit Judicial Council's \u201ccharacterization\u201d of a federal judge as engaging in a pattern of abusive behavior for years, McBryde, 264 F.3d at 54\u201357, or the United States Department of Justice's identification of certain films as political propaganda under the Foreign Agents Registration Act deterring a state senator from exhibiting those films, Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 473\u201374, 107 S.Ct. 1862, 95 L.Ed.2d 415 (1987).

{"paragraph": "Against this backdrop, the appellant argues that the district court should have excused Juror 31 for actual bias or, at least, for implied bias. Preserved challenges to the seating of a juror are reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Kar, 851 F.3d 59, 68 (1st Cir. 2017); United States v. Godfrey, 787 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir. 2015). Here, it is quite likely that the appellant's challenge (or at least some aspects of it) was either waived or forfeited. See, e.g., United States v. Soto, 799 F.3d 68, 96 (1st Cir. 2015); United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1993).
