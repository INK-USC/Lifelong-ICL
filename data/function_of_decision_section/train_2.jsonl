That ruling was an error. Although Hurley elected to have his forfeiture liability decided by the jury, the jury applied the pre-Honeycutt standard -- also known as Pinkerton12 liability -- that a defendant is liable for funds obtained by his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy to the extent that receipt of those amounts was reasonably foreseeable. Defendants' Forfeiture Order, 823 F. Supp. at 999. As we have explained, Honeycutt rejects Pinkerton for purposes of forfeiture liability under \u00a7 853(a)(1) (and, we are assuming, under \u00a7 1963(a)(3)) and instead requires a court to consider whether Hurley \u201cobtained, directly or indirectly\u201d the proceeds of the conspiracy. See Honeycutt, 137 S. Ct. at 1634-35. Hence, Hurley's forfeiture judgment cannot be justified by relying on the jury verdict, and we must ask instead whether he \u201cobtained\u201d the full $136 million, such that any error in relying on the jury verdict was harmless.", "label": "Conclusion", "id": "train_2_132"}

{"paragraph": "Khochinsky did not know whether the two paintings were one and the same. Regardless, Khochinsky believed that Girl with Dove might serve as a useful bargaining chip in his efforts to obtain restitution from Poland for his family's land. To that end, in 2010, he contacted Poland and offered Girl with Dove. A Polish official, indicating an interest in negotiating with Khochinsky, sent an expert to Khochinsky's gallery to examine the painting. The expert determined that Girl with Dove was the missing painting but did not share his conclusion with Khochinsky.", "label": "Facts", "id": "train_2_134"}
