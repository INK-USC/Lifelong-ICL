{"paragraph": "That is not to say that district courts do not have weighty obligations in conducting Section 404 proceedings. For starters, the court's resolution of the motion for sentence reduction must \u201ctake into account Congress's purposes\u201d in passing the Fair Sentencing Act and the First Step Act, which \u201ctogether[ ] are strong remedial statutes, meant to rectify disproportionate and racially disparate sentencing penalties.\u201d White, 984 F.3d at 89\u201390. In that regard, district courts must consider \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including \u201cnew statutory minimum or maximum penalties; current Guidelines; post-sentencing conduct; and other relevant information about a defendant's history and conduct.\u201d Id. at 90, 93 (quoting Hudson, 967 F.3d at 609). In White, we emphasized the particular relevance of post-sentencing conduct and the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 984 F.3d at 90\u201391. Additionally, district courts must give due consideration to relevant mitigating evidence offered by the defendant. Id. at 92\u201393. And sentence-reduction decisions under Section 404 \u201cmust be procedurally reasonable and supported by a sufficiently compelling justification.\u201d Id. at 91 (quoting Boulding, 960 F.3d at 784).", "label": "Conclusion", "id": "train_1_139"}
