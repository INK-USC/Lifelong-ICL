What solutions are in place, or what could be done to help bridge the gap? \n\nThese are definitely questions worth asking and addressing in order to help ensure more people take the necessary steps to getting vaccinated.  \nIn addition, I\u2019d advise talking to people about how to practice social distancing and respecting other people\u2019s rights by not forcing anyone to do anything if they do not wish to be part of those preventive measures and being more understanding of people\u2019s situations.
