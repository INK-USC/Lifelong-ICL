In particular  trying to use Simple Gallery when using the SD Card option in the Album Art Grabber app results in it just bringing up the regular viewing gallery when you open an image rather than selecting that image to be used Edit: Didn't expect to see such a fast response! I'm not sure if it's limited to just that app or it would happen with other apps as well. Glad to hear you'll try and fix it though Edit 2: The only issue I had with the app was fixed  and with speed that I haven't seen elsewhere  thank you!
