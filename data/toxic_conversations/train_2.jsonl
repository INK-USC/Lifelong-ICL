{"text": "Indeed several Prime Ministers have lost a vote of confidence, include our two previous Prime Ministers.\n\nHarper and the Conservatives lost a confidence vote in March, 2011, triggering the 2011 general election where the Conservatives came back to win a majority.  Previously Paul Martin and the Liberals lost a confidence vote in November of 2005, triggering the 2006 that the Conservatives ended up winning.\n\nWhat has not happened in Canadian history, at least at the Federal level, is for a government to lose a confidence vote when they have a majority.  It is theoretically possible but it would require at least a few members of a party to vote against their own government.  We would probably only see that if a MAJOR scandal had occurred.  It nearly happened following the Pacific Scandal in 1873 under Sir John A. Macdonald, but he stepped down before a confidence vote could be held (and didn't quite have a full-fledged majority anyway).", "label": "not toxic", "id": "train_2_3"}

{"text": "I just spent a couple of hours reading through \"The Rate of Return on Everything, 1870\u20132015\" by Jorda et al that provides the source material for Policy Tensor's blog article. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your view) the real estate returns calculated using a rent-price model are extrapolated from fairly sparse raw data. The authors heavily massaged what data they did have in an attempt to discard outliers and account for negative impacts like expenses and taxes. On the other hand, records for equity and fixed-income investments are considerably more extensive and do not rely on as many fudge factors like survivorship bias to arrive at reasonably serviceable return numbers. As an exercise in global economics, this study is so generalized as to be virtually meaningless to individual investors and may contain significant flaws that are impossible to detect because much of it relies on estimates where gaps in the raw data exist.", "label": "not toxic", "id": "train_2_8"}

{"text": "Excellent informative article.  I find it amazing that there are many Canadians who are opposed to immigration, in fact there are many organizations such as, Immigration Watch Canada, immigrationwatchcanada.org,  who regularly campaign and lobby the government to eliminate immigration altogether!  Given Canada's low birth rate, I wonder how these people would feel when the population starts to decline and then say, within a generation, 25% of the houses on their street are empty and the value of their home and whatever equity they had has plummeted.  Anyone who wants to see what population decline looks like should take a trip to Detroit. That city's population has declined from 1.7 million in 1957 to 650,000 today.  It is an urban wasteland with dozen of square miles of vacant lots and at least 50,00 abandoned house. In my opinion, we should double the immigration quota immediately.  Canada should be, after 150 years of confederation, a country of 100 million people at least.", "label": "not toxic", "id": "train_2_18"}
