He wanted transparency but the drafting process thus far has been more opaque than any major legislation in our modern history. He called for hearings, we've had none. Now, the plan slashes medicaid and abandons rural districts, the elderly, and the poor to the tune of 770 billion in cuts and 22 million plans cancelled. 115% projected increase in premiums for the elderly. \n\nAll the while, he won't answer his phones or speak with constituents. All the while, he meets with donors and lobbyists. He should just be honest and let his voters know he's intentionally screwing them.", "label": "not toxic", "id": "test_87"}
