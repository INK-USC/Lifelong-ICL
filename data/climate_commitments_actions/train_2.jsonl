The CMSI includes representatives from across the banking, insurance and investment sectors alongside pre-eminent Australian climate scientists working together under the auspices of the National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change (ESCC) Hub, professional services firms and finance sector industry bodies. The objectives of the CMSI are to provide open- source voluntary guidelines for financial institutions (banks, insurers and asset managers and owners) with consistent scientific and technical guidance on how to assess the physical risk of climate-related damage to homes, buildings and other critical infrastructure arising from extreme weather events - such as tropical cyclones, bushfires and floods. The CMSI focused on supporting implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations in addition to better understanding the financial system's exposures to climate-related risks. Two key reports were published in the 2020 financial year, including a finance report and a science report which are available at: https://www.cmsi.org.au/reports - Climate-KIC Australia (Climate-KIC) - The Group has been working with Climate-KIC and a number of other organisations, including government agencies and industry bodies on an Adaptation Finance Project. This project is exploring how the financial sector can invest in climate adaptation to deliver commercial returns and greater climate resilience with a view to developing insights into the creation of a scalable approach to adaptation finance. In 2020, the project completed a report that shares insights and makes recommendations for current and future projects focused on addressing the adaptation finance gap. This work has contributed to the adaptation finance discourse in Australia - the report is available at: https://climate-kic.org.au/our-projects/ adaptation-finance-project/ - Resilience Investment Vehicle (RIV) - The Group has been working with IAG, CSIRO and a number of other government agencies, industry groups and not-for-profits on a RIV.

This report is part of the Group's standard analysis of syste- mic risks, inter alia in the context of the analyses conducted by EIS on the impact of different risk factors on economic sectors. The purpose of the analysis was to identify and assess the main en- ergy transition and climate change risks incurred by BNP Paribas. It notably examined the impact of climate change on sovereign risk and the more or less significant exposure of various economic sectors to energy transition risks and opportuni- ties. This broad, detailed study found BNP Pari- bas' business model to be resilient to these risks, with respect to: o its businesses, and the sector and geographic classifications of its portfolios; o the measures taken to mitigate these risks. - For the first time, in 2019 and with the help of external specialists, BNP Paribas performed an assessment, on a sample of clients in its portfolio, of physical risks covering the consequences of cli- mate change (extreme weather events) on the as- sets of Group clients. They generate financial risks for companies not only through direct impacts on their assets, but also in terms of indirect impacts through their supply chains and markets.
