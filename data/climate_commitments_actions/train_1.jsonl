Over the past 20 years, the Bank has voluntarily adopted various measures to considerably improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated.
